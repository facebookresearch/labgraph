# LabGraph Extensions

Here you can find optional extensions to install for labgraph to provide
additional functionality. They must be manually installed as they are not
included with labgraph core.

If you would like to write an extension for labgraph you can follow
labgraph_viz as an example and create a PR on GitHub.
